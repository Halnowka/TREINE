# **App Name**: Kinetic Tracker

## Core Features:

- Workout Day Selection: Intuitive toggle buttons for quick 'Pull Day' or 'Push Day' selection.
- Exercise Logging: Streamlined cards for easy exercise data entry, including sets, reps, and optional notes.
- Workout History: Dynamic Workout History display to view and manage logged workouts.
- Save Workout: Save workout logs with date and workout type (push/pull)
- Picker Wheel: Interactive picker wheel component for selecting sets and reps, providing a visually engaging alternative to standard number inputs, especially on mobile devices.

## Style Guidelines:

- Light gray (#CCCCCC) for interactive elements, ensuring clear visibility against the dark background.
- Almost black (#0A0A0A) for a minimalist dark theme, as per user's request.
- Slightly lighter gray (#BDBDBD) to subtly highlight interactive elements.
- 'Inter' (sans-serif) as specified by the user. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Simple, clear icons for exercises, reinforcing the minimalist design.
- Vertical layout for easy content scanning, especially on mobile.
- Subtle animations for transitions and interactive feedback, such as expanding exercise cards.
